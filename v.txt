1) Why do we need DevOps?

1.Increase deployment frequency
2.Lessen lead time between fixes
3.Lower failure rate of new releases
4.In case of new release crashing, have a faster mean time to recovery
5.DevOps helps in fulfilling all these requirements and thus, achieving seamless software delivery. Full-fledged organizations like Amazon
6.Etsy, and Google have adopted DevOps methodology resulting in achieving performance levels that were previously uncharted.

2) what are the major benefits of implementing DevOps automation?

   
1.Removal of the possibility of human error from the CD equation (Core benefit)
2.As tasks become more predictable and repeatable, it is easy to identify and correct when something goes wrong.
  Hence, it results in producing more reliable and robust systems
3.Removes bottlenecks from the CI pipeline. It results in increased deployment frequency and decreased number of failed deployments. 
 Both of them are important DevOps KPIs
